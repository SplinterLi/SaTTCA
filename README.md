Implementation of "Scale-aware Test-time Click Adaptation for Pulmonary Nodule and Mass Segmentation"

Pulmonary nodules and masses are crucial imaging features in lung cancer screening that require careful management in clinical diagnosis. The segmentation performance on various sizes of lesions of nodule and mass is still challenging. Here, we use a multi-scale neural network with scale-aware test-time adaptation to address this challenge.
